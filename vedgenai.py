st.markdown("""
### 1. Hyper-Realistic Synthetic Humans
Generate fully customizable, photorealistic 3D humans with diverse ethnicities, body types, ages, and attire.  
Include micro-expressions and natural movements for high-fidelity simulations.

### 2. Context-Aware Scenario Generation
AI can place synthetic humans in complex, real-world environmentsâ€”like crowded streets, offices, or industrial settings.  
Dynamic lighting, weather, and perspective adjustments for realistic model training.

### 3. Emotion & Gesture Annotation
Automatically tag emotions, gestures, and actions in videos, enabling advanced human-computer interaction AI applications.

### 4. Bias Detection & Mitigation Tools
Built-in analytics that detect underrepresented groups in datasets and automatically balance diversity.  
Provides reports to improve AI fairness and inclusivity.

### 5. Rapid Dataset Generation
Create millions of annotated images and videos in hours, significantly reducing AI training time and costs.

### 6. Plug-and-Play API Integration
Developers can directly integrate VedgenAIâ€™s dataset generation into existing AI pipelines with a simple API.

### 7. Privacy-First Synthetic Data
Ensures zero exposure of personal data while providing fully realistic datasets for sensitive applications.

### 8. Adaptive Scenario Simulation
AI can automatically generate rare or edge-case scenarios (e.g., unusual driving conditions, medical anomalies) to improve model robustness.

### 9. AR & VR Ready Data
Generates datasets optimized for augmented reality and virtual reality applications, enhancing immersive experiences.

### 10. AI-Powered Feedback Loop
The system evaluates model performance and suggests dataset refinements for continuous improvement.
